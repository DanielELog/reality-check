NIST references a different Go project in its page as well, unclear where the current one belongs since it doesn't seem as a standalone repo

^^^ maybe should include these instead, to the Go vul list (as of now, these issues are not present there)

https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/security/advisories/GHSA-wm8q-9975-xh5v <- two major releases have two fixes for one vul; for now, noted the most recent version (5.x.x)

same applies to:
- CVE-2022-21699,https://github.com/ipython/ipython

_____________________________________________________________

NIST presents two different commits as patch/fix (not specifying which is which)
https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/2427d4a99bed35baefd8f17ba422cb7aae8dcca7 <- presented from a (very old?) version, unknown what preceded it, to the modern ones
https://github.com/openstack/nova/commit/b0feaffdb2b1c51182b8dce41b367f3449af5dd9 <- gives more concrete data, which patched and vul versions were deduced from; however, GitHub states these commits do not belong to the linked repo

Keep it or Change it?

https://github.com/wichert/pyrad gets automatically redirected to https://github.com/pyradius/pyrad

Change the former link appearances to the latter?

https://github.com/numpy/numpy	<- initially linked commit_hash was present in great number of versions; unclear which are vul and patch 

However, a different (possibly rebased) commit was found (961c43da78bf97ce63183b27c338db7ea77bed85) that lead to noted patched and vul versions. These versions do correspond with NIST information

CVE-2021-43818,https://github.com/lxml/lxml <- two CWEs, one CVE, three commits
one commit was omitted and used as patched version hash

two other commits appear for both CWEs. Change to one commit - one CWE policy?
